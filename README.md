# GridmiAPI

Very simple and powerful work with RestAPI for Android.

## Introduction

This library will allow you to very easily and intuitively execute server requests. You do not need to think: about restoring the URI of your request, about threads, about the results. You simply fulfill the request and get a response. You can also interrupt the request, as the task instance is the most common `java.lang.Thread ()`.
